Revision history for DBIx-Class-LibXMLdoc

     - Swapped id --> ID for parser error feedback.
     - Renamed parser_settings --> libXMLdoc_parser_settings.
     - Started live tests with SQLite but they aren't going well so
       they have to wait.
     - Pod spelling mistakes.

     - Doing an "_a" release because I think I might have broken
       things but want it available for testing.
     - Moved perlcritic.t to /xt. It was causing errors on systems
       with different Perl::Critic extras installed.
     - base --> parent.
     - A little more sanity checking in initialization.
     - Added the parser_settings method.
     - Switched Makefile to Module::Install.
     - Changed wrapper to "doc" with attributes for "table," "column,"
       and version of the module.
     - Made parse instantiation only happen once; still only on first
       demand. This might be a tiny speed-up in certain cases.

     - 0.02 still listed 0.01 as version in POD; uh, now it's 0.03 anyway.
     - I think there was a stupid error in the perl critic test file;
       not "use"ing Test::More that was causing test failures on the CPAN.

     - It was putting the _Doc methods into the top space instead of
       the calling space.
     - Spelling fix.
     - Added note about UTF8Columns.

0.01 2006-11-28 21:24
     - Initial version from module-starter.
     - Needs better tests.
